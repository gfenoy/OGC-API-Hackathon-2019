==== Motivation to Participate

Spacebel was present in London to participate to the OGC API for Processes activities contributing an OGC API Processes implementation (Proxy).

In addition, Spacebel participated remotely on behalf of the https://www.databio.eu/en/[H2020 DataBio project] contributing a Catalog Server implementation hosting application and collection metadata from the DataBio Hub (https://www.databiohub.eu/registry/) aiming to improve alignment of the DataBio catalog and Hub implementation with the OGC API Common specification in addition to the Testbed-15 EOPAD discovery approach.

==== Implemented Solution

(1) DataBio Catalog Server (https://databio.spacebel.be/eo-catalog/readme.html) hosting EO applications and services (OGC 19-020), EO collections (OGC 17-084) and EO product (OGC 17-003) metadata implementing OpenSearch (OGC 10-032r8 and OGC 13-026r8) and Open API Common interfaces.  Resources `/`, `/conformance`, `/collections` were implemented and interoperability was demonstrated through TIE testing with the http://frozen-lime.surge.sh/[OpenSphere client] implementing OGC API Features provided by another participant. A `limit`
parameter needed to be added server-side in addition to the `maximumRecords` parameter (which was used to comply with OASIS searchRetrieve (SRU) specifications) which was originally mapped on `{count}`.


(2) Web Processing Service (http://34.77.240.214/ades-proxy/swagger-ui/index.html) with a OGC API for Processes as defined in OGC Testbed 14 (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spacebel/testbed14/master/json-spec/wps-t_tb14_spacebel-v1.6.yaml), including the Transactional and the Quoting & Billing extensions. Resources `/`, `/conformance`, `/processes`, `/jobs`were implemented and interoperability was shown through TIE testing with the Solenix client.


==== Proposed Alternatives

The Catalog Server combines an OpenSearch interface with GeoJSON responses (OGC 13-026r8, OGC 17-047) for simple clients and a more advanced OpenAPI-based interface.

==== Experiences with OGC API Specifications

Spacebel has experience with Swagger and OpenAPI since 2016 and already used this technology in previous OGC Testbeds.

===== OGC API Common

Wrapping an OpenSearch compliant catalog with an OGC API Common interface was achieved as part of the hackaton.  Extending the interface to OGC API Features (mainly temporal and geograpical searches) is future work.

The main issue encountered was to define what /collections (which has a fixed response) format might return in the case of an OpenSearch catalog hosting EO application and service metadata, EO collection metadata and EO product metadata simultaneously.  The proposed approach can be seen at https://databio.spacebel.be/eo-catalog/collections.  The hyperlinks included in this response allow to refer directly to an OpenSearch OSDD (rel="search") and to the applicable JSON Schemas (rel="describedby").

The figure below shows that service and application data could be sucessfully discovered via the OpenSphere client accessing the DataBio Catalog Server.

The OpenSpere client also allows browsing EO Product metadata, visualise corresponding footprints on the map and display metadata properties for a particular EO Product.

===== OGC API for Processes

A major discussion during the OGC Hackaton 2019 (London) was about describing the process interfaces (i.e. the Process Description including inputs and outputs definitions) directly in JSON Schema and/or OpenAPI. Indeed, as OpenAPI already supports descriptions of schemas/interfaces, this would remove the need of using a specific Process Description schema, and this would also ease the work of Web client developers.

For each existing process, a resource with a HTTP path is defined in the API document. Therefore, processes are discovered through the API document (no need of discovery and describe process operations) and the Client directly knows how to invoke the execution. The API document is illustrated below:

.Example of processes exposed as OpenAPI operations
[source]
----
openapi: 3.0.0
paths:
 # For each process the path and interface is provided as below
 '/processes/mySampleProcess/jobs':
   post:
      summary: Start mySampleProcess execution.
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/mySampleProcessExecuteRequest'
      responses:
        '201':
          headers:
            Location:
              schema:
                type: string
              description: URL to check the status of the execution/job.

A complete report about the mapping between the Process Description specification and the JSON Schema format is available at https://github.com/spacebel/testbed14/wiki/OGC-Hackaton-2019.

Others topics have also been covered during the Hackaton:

* The transactional extension specification has been submitted to the offical github repository at https://github.com/opengeospatial/wps-rest-binding/commit/7bdee9df5652ad3a7ad13075c535b84f9b264d0b.
* An extension supporting callbacks would allow a more modern pattern for monitoring the jobs status. Instead of observing (repeated polling), the client can be notified on the following event: onSuccess, onFailure, onUpdate. Spacebel has proposed a draft specification for such notification feature (relying on OpenAPI callbacks): https://github.com/opengeospatial/wps-rest-binding/commit/8cc2bdaf6483af7d8c5a85c7ad0a45b8e68cc4b6
* A very classical issue related to the possibility to report list of files as outputs was discussed. The conclusion of the discussion was that the new Processing API should support the presence of output file arrays.
* Some fixes listed at https://github.com/opengeospatial/wps-rest-binding/issues have been proposed during the Hackaton.

==== Other Impressions & Recommendations

Further alignment of the OpenSearch Catalog Server with OGC API Features interfaces, requires reconciling the time and bbox related search parameters from OGC 10-032 and OGC API Features.  While OGC 10-032r8 has separate search parameters representing the start and end of a search interval `{time:start}` and `{time:end}` respectively, OGC API Features imposes a single search parameter to represent the interval.

OpenSearch and OpenAPI Common convergence would benefit from a revision of OGC 10-032r8 to ensure that the geo:box, time:start and time:end can be combined in a single URL template with the actual HTTP query parameter names imposed by OpenAPI Common for temporal and geographical search.

The approach to represent hyperlinks in JSON is unfortunately different from the encoding proposed by OGC 14-055r2 which means that an OpenSearch implemention based simultaneously on OGC 14-055r2 and OGC 17-047 in combination with OGC API Common will have different encodings for links in search responses and in other resource representations (e.g. `/conformance`, `/` etc).

The OGC API specifications are imposing to advertise "paths" in the Landing Page response and also contain wording suggesting that actual path names such as "api", "conformance", "collections" are mandatory and not just examples.  This should be made clearer and it seems redundant to impose the declaration of paths in the landing page if indeed the path names are "fixed".

Making (JSON) data models available as separate JSON Schemas (https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/keywords/) and not mixing them with actual OpenAPI descriptions (but refer to them) would allow validating JSON representations separately with JSON schema validation tools and before a service is put up.
