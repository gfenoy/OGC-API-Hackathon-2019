The MSC implemented and deployed an instance of pygeoapi - a Python server implementation of the emerging OGC API specifications. A screenshot of the landing page of the deployed service is shown in <<img_msc_pygeoapi>>. The software was configured to offer an interface that conforms to the OGC API - Features and OGC API - Processes specifications.
